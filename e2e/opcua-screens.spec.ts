/**
 * THE OPC UA PANEL IN A REAL BROWSER, WITH A REAL SERVER, AND A PICTURE OF EVERY STEP (#1677).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every other suite proves the provider ANSWERS correctly: the unit tests over
 * fakes, the integration tests over a recorded server and an in-process one, the route tests through
 * the real handlers, the live check against the plant simulator. None of them can see what a reader
 * sees. On the MQTT provider a screenshot found what 1,400 passing tests could not - the panel's
 * completeness sentence shipped in a SURFACE colour, 1.09:1 against the ground it sat on, so the
 * one line telling a reader the list might be incomplete was invisible. A screenshot is not a gate,
 * and that is the point: this file takes the pictures, and a person looks at them.
 *
 * It needs the fixture of `tests/fixtures/opcua/README.md` on 127.0.0.1:54840. Without it the
 * connection refuses and the test says so rather than passing quietly.
 *
 * The connection is made the way a reader makes it: open the dialog, pick OPC UA, type the endpoint,
 * choose None, connect. Nothing is seeded.
 */

 * path itself is a session id nobody else has. `test-results/` is already the directory Playwright
 * writes to and is already in `.gitignore`. The variable is there for a pass that wants the pictures
 * somewhere specific, which is how they were collected for the guide.
