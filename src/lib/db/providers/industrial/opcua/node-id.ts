/**
 * Node ids and the path keys the Keys panel walks (#1677, Part 6 5.1.12).
 *
 * THE KEY IS AN ESCAPED BROWSE PATH, AND THAT IS A DECISION WITH A MEASUREMENT BEHIND IT. The Keys
 * panel addresses a level by a literal text prefix and derives folders from a separator inside the
 * key's own text (`KeyScanOptions.level`). A browse path is the natural fit, `Objects/OpcPlc/Slow`,
 * except that a BrowseName may contain the separator: measured on the issue's own first fixture,
 * four names contain `/`, four contain `:`, four contain `.`, and one contains every candidate at
 * once, `Special_"!§$%&/()=?`´\+~*'#_-:.;,<>|@^°€µ{[]}`. Microsoft ships it deliberately.
 *
 * So the separator is escaped rather than chosen. A segment's `/` becomes `%2F` and a literal `%`
 * becomes `%25`, which is percent-encoding's own rule and reversible. The panel still sees what it
 * expects, a literal prefix of a `/`-separated key, and the shared contract is not widened for one
 * engine: every other engine's walk keeps the meaning it had.
 *
 * WHAT THE PANEL WILL SHOW IS MORE ROWS THAN NODES, and that is correct rather than a defect. The
 * address space is a directed acyclic graph: re-measured on the documented fixture, 6,769 nodes
 * reachable from `i=85` have 7,040 distinct browse paths, because 41 of them hang off more than one
 * parent - 39 off two and two of them off thirty - which gives 215 nodes more than one path. Each path is a real path the server
 * publishes. A tree that showed a node once would have to pick a parent the server does not
 * privilege, and the node ids themselves cannot stand in for a path: 1,299 of those 6,769 cannot be
 * built from their own browse name at all.
 *
 * Measured: no cycles. An exhaustive enumeration with no visited set terminates at 7,040 paths, a
 * memoised count over each node's parents agrees, and the deepest node is at depth 7.
 *
 * A NODE ID WRITTEN WITH `ns=` IS NOT A NAME, AND NOTHING HERE REWRITES ONE. A namespace index is a
 * position in the server's own NamespaceArray, which Part 6 5.1.12 says "is supplied per Session",
 * and the `nsu=` form exists for places with no such context, "such as column in a database table".
 * Measured on OPC PLC: the documented fixture publishes EIGHT namespaces, and a second container
 * from the same digest with the same flags publishes the same eight in the same order - except
 * entry 1, `urn:OpcPlc:<hostname>`, which names that container alone. One more start-up flag moves
 * the rest: with `--alm` the array is nine entries and `AlarmsInstance` is inserted at index 6, so
 * `ReferenceTest` and `Diagnostics` shift from 6 and 7 to 7 and 8. So a request
 * a reader saves with `ns=` may address a different node after a restart; this provider sends what
 * the reader typed and converts nothing, which `docs/providers/opcua.md` section 12 states as the
 * limitation it is.

/**
 * Whether a node id is one this provider will dial a server with.
 *
 * Part 6 5.1.12 gives four identifier forms and two namespace forms. This refuses what the grammar
 * refuses rather than what a server happens to dislike, because a refusal before the request is a
 * sentence a reader can act on and a refusal after it is a status code they cannot.
 *
 * THE RANGES AND THE GUID SHAPE ARE PART OF THE GRAMMAR, which a looser pattern let through and the
 * reader paid for in library strings. Measured against the real server with the pattern that only
 * counted characters:
 *  - `g=------------------------------------` (36 dashes) was accepted as a GUID, and the library
 *    threw an Error whose message was EMPTY: the reader was answered "A read failed: ".
 *  - `ns=70000;s=x` was accepted, and the library answered `NodeId: invalid namespace value` - its
 *    own internal string, reaching a reader who cannot act on it. A namespace index is a UInt16
 *    (Part 6 5.2.2.9) and a numeric identifier a UInt32, so both have an end.
 * The GUID is the five-group form Part 6 5.1.12 writes, 8-4-4-4-12, not 36 characters of anything.
