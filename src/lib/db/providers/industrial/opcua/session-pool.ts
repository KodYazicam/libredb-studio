/**
 * One session per connection, reused (#1677 O-S6).
 *
 * A SERVER'S SESSION TABLE IS SHARED WITH THE PLANT. Measured: OPC PLC allows 100 sessions by
 * default and three of ours read back as CurrentSessionCount 3, so a provider that opened one
 * session per request would compete with the SCADA clients the plant actually runs on. The
 * in-process server's default is 10, which makes the failure mode cheap to test.
 *
 * AND STUDIO LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND. Every session this opens is closed, on every path out including
 * every failure, which is the half of O-S6 a test can assert by reading CurrentSessionCount before
 * and after a run. That reading is not portable, though: OPC PLC and open62541 answer `i=2277`,
 * asyncua answers Good with an empty Variant, and Milo answers BadNotReadable even to an
 * authenticated session. So the live check reports the count as unavailable where it cannot be
 * read, and never as zero.
