/**
 * What an OPC UA status code means, in words a reader can act on (#1677, Part 4 7.38).
 *
 * THE TABLE IS WRITTEN FROM FOUR SERVERS, NOT ONE, because the same failure is reported four ways.
 * Measured on a wrong password: OPC PLC, open62541 and asyncua-with-a-user-manager all answer
 * `BadUserAccessDenied`; Milo answers `BadIdentityTokenInvalid`; and a STOCK asyncua accepted every
 * username with every password, including an invented one, because its default user manager returns
 * a user for anything. So a sentence keyed on one server's code would be wrong on the next, and a
 * code this table does not know travels as itself rather than as a guess.
 *
 * NO SENTENCE ECHOES A CREDENTIAL, and that needs a rule about the error OBJECT and not only its
 * message. Measured: `node-opcua-client` throws an Error carrying `request` and `response`, so
 * `JSON.stringify(error)` emits the ActivateSessionRequest including `userName`. The message itself
 * is clean. Every caller logs `error.message`, never the error.

  // ^ That last clause is a PROMISE, and `OpcuaSessionPool.withSession` is what keeps it: a read
  // that fails on a stale session drops the session and runs once more on a fresh one. Measured

  // true, and the connection stayed bricked until Studio restarted.

  BadContinuationPointInvalid:

A server validates a continued read against the details of the read that handed the point out, so a window or a page size that changed between pages invalidates it; measured on OPC PLC, the rest of the history is then unreachable by token.",

  BadConnectionClosed:
    "the connection closed. An answer larger than the client's own message limit closes the channel rather than failing one request, and every later request on that session then fails this way.",
  BadTimeout: "the server did not answer in time.",
  BadEncodingLimitsExceeded:
    "the answer was larger than the encoder would build. Measured on OPC PLC: a Browse of 2,500 nodes answered this and the session stayed usable, so the request was too wide rather than the connection broken; a narrower page reads the same level.",
