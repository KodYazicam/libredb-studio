/**
 * The Snowflake error table: every way a request fails, as one `SnowflakeError` category and the sentence a person
 * reads, and the house class each category becomes at the provider's boundary.
 *
 * Classification reads Snowflake's code, the HTTP status, the transport kind and Studio's own state (the sign-in
 * method, whether the submit was accepted, the unit's operative keyword), never message text. The one value read out
 * of a message is the login-failure id of a refused key pair, and it is copied into a statement only when it has the
 * UUID shape.
 *
 * This module is the `serverText` entry: every server text passes `serverText` with the connection's secret forms
 * (the PAT, the key's passphrase and every JWT still in use, computed by the caller at each signing and passed as
 * `secretForms`) before any sentence is built from it, and is cut afterwards, so a text that holds a form is withheld
 * whole and never shown in part. A copyable statement names identifiers only through `snowflakeIdentifier`, prints
 * the public key only from Studio's own SPKI base64, and never holds the private key.
 *
 * Written for Snowflake rather than shared with Databend's table: a provider imports no other provider. Pure: no I/O,
 * no clock.
