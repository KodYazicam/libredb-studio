/**
 * One session per connection, and nothing left behind (#1677 O-S6).

 * A SERVER'S SESSION TABLE IS SHARED WITH THE PLANT'S OWN CLIENTS. Measured: OPC PLC allows 100 and

 * SCADA systems the plant runs on. These tests assert the pooling and the closing, which is the
 * half of O-S6 a unit test can reach; the before-and-after session count belongs to the live check.
