/**
 * What is refused before a socket exists (#1677 O-S2, O-S3, O-S7, O-S8).
 *
 * EVERY ENDPOINT SHAPE BELOW WAS READ OFF A REAL SERVER on 2026-10-11/12, because the rule the issue
 * proposed does not survive the shapes that actually occur. It said to refuse "a username on a
 * server whose UserName token policy is itself None". Measured: on secured endpoints OPC PLC and
 * open62541 leave the token's policy NULL, which Part 4 7.41 says means the channel's policy, so
 * that rule would refuse a perfectly protected connection; and stock asyncua declares the token's
 * policy as None on its only endpoint, where the password really would cross in the clear.
