/**
 * Scripted transports and injected time for the Snowflake transport, rows and statements tests.
 *
 * `scriptedTransports` stands where `createNodeTransport` and `createNodeByteTransport` stand in the provider's deps.
 * Every text transport it builds is a lane, numbered from 0 in build order; the byte transport records as lane -1.
 * Every request is recorded with its method, its full URL, its headers (the connection's, then the request's own, then
 * the signer's for the byte transport, as the shared transports merge them) and its body. A request is answered by
 * the first rule added with `answer` whose method and path match and that still holds an answer; a request no rule
 * answers fails by its method and URL, so a test sees exactly its script.
 *
 * The signal and the byte caps are honoured as the shared transports honour them: a closed transport or an aborted
 * signal fails before anything is recorded, a text answer longer than `maxResponseBytes` fails as `too-large`, a byte
 * answer longer than `truncateAt` is cut and reported `truncated`, and a hanging answer fails only when its signal fires
 * or its transport closes. A `wait` answer is answered when the test resolves its promise.
 *
 * `fakeClock`, `scriptedTokens` and `testDeps` give the rest of the deps with no real timer: a clock that moves only
 * when the test or a sleep moves it, sleeps that record their delay and return at once, a fixed random value,
 * sequential UUIDs, and deadlines that fire only when the test fires them.
